# VidLii Live Sub Counter
## A live subcount built for VidLii by JonBot415 and geekyTV. (Special thanks to Jan)
### So... what does it do?
It gives a live check on how many subscribers a user has.

The VidLii Live Count implements VidLii's user API to automatically check the amount of subscribers you have. Here, we've released the code for developers to make their own widgets and sites using our Live Count. 

### Why would I need this?
I don't know... maybe to provide a live and accurate sub count that updates automatically every one and a half seconds..? Yep.

### And how would I enjoy this?
Because you could make stuff. And see your stats. Just about it!

### How do I install it?
Installation is very easy. Download a release and upload the ZIP contents into your webserver. Just make sure you have PHP installed on your webserver and the JSON module is activated.

### Developers' Note:
Enjoy the live sub counter and help improve onto it!
